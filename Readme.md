# Pre-requisites
Currently requires that you have a mangadex.org account, as I did not plan to use the API initially.
This requirement can be removed with a little tweaking ( exclusively use the API).

External libraries:
    * wxPython

# Usage

4) Select the chapters you want and press 'DL selected'
