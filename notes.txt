Day 1 of CoVID-19-induced isolation.

Current issues:
    1)-> not able to login (using _requests_ lib)
        link: https://mangadex.org/ajax/actions.ajax.php?function=login&nojs=1
    
    unable to get session


The scraping is the easy part; this user-related shit is the hard part

Issue 1 resolved. Login possible.
Require user to enable "View All" in H-manga setting and save settings.
Could also do through the modal, but too lazy to programmatically change those settings

Issue 2) Parsing problems
    Should be resolved fairly quickly

Reopening issue 1. The "View All" settings are, contrary to mangadex's claims, browser-based, and not account-based.

Guess I'll need to play around with that modal stuff after all.

My attempts to change the setting end with a short message "Hacking attempt... go away".
Need to circumvent this.
I'm not cracking anything anyway.
