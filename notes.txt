Day 1 of CoVID-19-induced isolation.

Current issues:
    1)-> not able to login (using _requests_ lib)
        link: https://mangadex.org/ajax/actions.ajax.php?function=login&nojs=1
    
    unable to get session


The scraping is the easy part; this user-related shit is the hard part

Issue 1 resolved. Login possible.
Require user to enable "View All" in H-manga setting and save settings.
Could also do through the modal, but too lazy to programmatically change those settings

Issue 2) Parsing problems
    Should be resolved fairly quickly

Reopening issue 1. The "View All" settings are, contrary to mangadex's claims, browser-based, and not account-based.

Guess I'll need to play around with that modal stuff after all.

My attempts to change the setting end with a short message "Hacking attempt... go away".
Need to circumvent this.
I'm not cracking anything anyway.

Done: successful retrieval of chapters ( even for h-manga )
    possible issue: can we get all chapters in one go? (mangadex uses page numbers)


Chief issue: 
    need to find the last page number, given a chapter

for feature:
    <download chapter>


methods to circumvent:
    1) look for indicators in html
    2) request the underlying image URLs until a 404 is encountered

Issue: getting the image sources.
Can't find where the code requests the images.
Did find a header-header convo

Will just use the official API

I am a humongous dunderhead.
All of that homepage_setting AJAX stuff could've been avoided if I'd used the
API from the start.
To be fair, I didn't really put much stock into the mangadex API ( since they themselves said it was
under development ). However, since I ended up having to rely on it in the end, all of my previous work is
now worthless.

To-do: 
    1) revamp code, make full use of API and remove useless code
    2) improve GUI
    3) add CLI option


Honestly, I'm too busy/lazy to do anything about this right now.
It ain't broke, so I ain't fixin' it.
Perhaps in a couple of weeks.
